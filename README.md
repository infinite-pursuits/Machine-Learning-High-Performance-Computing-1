This is the repository of my assignment submission to ['High Performance Computing for Machine Learning'](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall18/CSCI-GA.3033-022/) course at NYU in Fall 2018.


The questions are in lab1_Questions.pdf, the answers are in lab1_Answers.pdf. You can find all the code(+batch files and executables) in the code folder as per the naming convention defined in lab1_Questions.pdf.
